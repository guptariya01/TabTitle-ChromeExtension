# TabTitle-ChromeExtension
I made a Chrome Extension which has a button in the popup , when button is clicked the extension automatically pick up the title of the current tab and show it in popup itself.
By building this project I was able to dive deep into learning how to make a chrome extension and also I was able to learn about various functions and methods of java script and implement it on my project.
Project was made by taking help from documentations and various tutorials as well as articles.
Project was made as a task given to me.
